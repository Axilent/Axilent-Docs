Axilent Documentation Website
=============================

This is the code for the Axilent documentation website.  It's a simple Django-based website, using the Django-Axilent plugin, that is backed by the Axilent platform.  We've made it open source as a demonstration of integrating with the system.

The live website will be viewable at [docs.axilent.com](http://docs.axilent.com).
